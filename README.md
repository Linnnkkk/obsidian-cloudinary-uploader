2. Install the Plugin
    - Clone this repo
    - Install dependencies with `yarn` or `npm`
    - `npm run dev` will start compilation
3. Enable the Plugin
4. Configure the settings and set your:
    - Cloud Name
    - Upload Preset Name ([Set that here](https://support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018796451-Unsigned-Uploads-Security-Considerations))
    - Set a Folder Name
## Thanks
Special thanks to:
1. @Creling and [their repo here](https://github.com/Creling/obsidian-image-uploader).  As this was my first time creating an Obsidian plugin, their base really helped.
